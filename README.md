# Scrape-Projects-for-Students
I scraped university directories in order to access emails for my client gudWork for advertising practices. Since none of the directories provided access to the full database, I had to find unique ways to obtain the emails, from using lists of the most common names, to using the alphabet in the search bar.

IMPORTANT: This project was done with the chrome driver version 103.
I uploaded chrome driver for version 107 so that the code may run, but some incompatabilities may occur.
Also, for websites requiring username and password, I have hidden the username and password for privacy reasons. 
Upon request I can send videos of the scrape working at hd1202@nyu.edu
