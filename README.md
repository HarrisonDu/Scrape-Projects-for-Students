# Scrape-Projects-for-Students
I scraped university directories in order to access emails for my client gudWork for advertising practices. Since none of the directories provided access to the full database, I had to find unique ways to obtain the emails, from using lists of the most common names, to using the alphabet in the search bar.

IMPORTANT: This project was done with the chrome driver version 103, so in order for the code to work please chrome driver must be updated
